* Introduction

** Hello!
   
   My name is *Ed Herbst.*  I'm currently an economist at the Federal
   Reserve Board.  
   #+LATEX: \\~\\~\\
   I'm interested in (Bayesian) macroeconometrics, and I'm excited to
   spend the next two weeks talking about it with you!
   
** The next two weeks
   The syllabus has a rough plan of where we're going. 
   #+LATEX: \\~\\~\\
   But, in my experience, there is usually some re-optimization.
   #+LATEX: \\~\\~\\
   If there's something you'd like to talk about, or spend more (or
   less) time on, just let me know. 
   
** A note on teaching   
   This is my first time teaching over the internet.  
   #+LATEX: \\~\\~\\
   If it's anything like work meetings, there will be hiccups.  Please bear with me!
   #+LATEX: \\~\\~\\
   In-person or remote, these kinds of courses work best with
   participation, so don't be shy!
